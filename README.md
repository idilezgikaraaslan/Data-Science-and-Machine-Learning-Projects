# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my projects from the **Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp** (Udemy), which I am currently completing. The projects demonstrate practical applications of core concepts in data science and machine learning using Python.

## Topics and Tools

Projects include applications in:

- **Data Analysis** using `pandas` and `NumPy`
- **Data Visualization** with `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas`
- **Machine Learning** with `scikit-learn`:
  - Regression and classification
  - Clustering (e.g., K-Means)
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Neural networks and deep learning
- **Big Data Tools** (introductory) using `PySpark`

Each project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and focuses on solving real-world problems using appropriate techniques and libraries.
